# Predicting-Infectious-Rate-using-Lstm-Keras-Method

This repo contain 5 files: 2 double files contain both the codes (ipynb) and html file knitted. 1 pdf file documented motivation and results from prediction.
Predicting Covid using two methods: 

## 1) LSTM alone, through Keras.
  Produce better result, with prediction line not as far off as other method.
## 2) Time series prediction RNN (3 flavors: LSTM, GRU, and "Vanilla") through Darts.
  Need rework. Possible future attempt?
